# CYBER-ATTACKS-IN-SDN-ENVIRONMENT-USING-NS2
The evolution of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the future
generations of Advanced networks brings to reality the of the future
and their innovative scenarios. The edge computing paradigm
together with network function virtualization techniques and the
software-defined networking paradigm enable self-management,
adaptability, and security of devices and data management processes.
However, the logical centralized approach of the SDN control plane
and its protocols introduce new vulnerabilities which affect the
security of the network infrastructure.
The paper at hand proposes an SDN architecture for the edge
computing infrastructure to detect and mitigate cybersecurity attacks
exploiting SDN vulnerabilities in real time and on-demand.
A motivating example and experiments presented in this paper
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture in a realistic
scenario.
